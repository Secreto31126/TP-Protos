1. Introduction

   This document describes a text-based connection oriented protocol for
   setting configuration values and retrieving statistics from a POP3
   server. The protocol allows clients to set and get configuration
   values and obtain server statistics.

2. Generalizations

   Initialy, the server host SHOULD start the MSMP server by listening
   on TCP port 4321.

   All server responses MUST start with:
        
        +OK

   in case of possitive results. Or:

        -ERR
   
   in case of negative results.

   Messages providing more information MAY be appended to the end
   of the response. 

   All responses MUST NOT exceed 512 characters in total and MUST
   be terminated with CRLF.

          RFC for Mail Server Management Protocol          November 2024


3. Start of connection
   
   On connection to the server, the server MUST send an initial
   positive message indicating the server's version. 
   
   In response the client MUST authenticate themselves in the
   following 2 steps:

   Firstly, the client sends this message:
        
        USER <username>

   To which the server will always answer positively. And then
   the client sends:

        PASS <password>

   If the user and password are correct, the server MUST send
   a positive response.
   If the user does not exist or the password is not correct,
   the server SHOULD send a negative response.

        Note: The server SHOULD NOT send different responses to
        when the user does not exists and when the password is
        not correct. This may be a security vulnerability.

   Possible responses:
        +OK Logged in
        -ERR Invalid credentials

   Example:
        S: +OK MSMP1 server ready
        C: USER user1
        S: +OK
        C: PASS pass1
        S: -ERR Invalid credentials
        C: USER user1
        S: +OK
        C: PASS pass2
        S: +OK Logged in

4. ADD

   In order to add or update a user, the client MUST send the following
   command:

        ADD <username> <password>

   If the user with the given username already exists, the password
   SHOULD be updated.
   Otherwise, if the user does not exist and there is space for a new
   user, the server MUST create the new user and its maildir and send a
   positive response.
   If the user does not exist and there is no more space for users, the
   server SHOULD send a negative response.

          RFC for Mail Server Management Protocol          November 2024


     Note: usernames SHOULD be limited to 40 characters, as it is the
     limit set by POP3.

   Possible responses:
        +OK Added user
        +OK Updated password
        -ERR Unsafe username
        -ERR User limit reached

   Example:
        C: ADD user1 pass1
        S: +OK Updated password
        C: ADD user2 pass2
        S: +OK Added user
        C: ADD 41_character_long_username_______________ pass1
        S: -ERR Unsafe username
        C: ADD user3 pass3
        S: -ERR User limit reached 

5. DELE

  In order to delete a user, the client MUST send the following command:

        DELE <username>

  If the user with the given username exists, the server MUST send a
  positive response.
  Otherwise, if the user does not exist or the user is currently logged
  in, the server SHOULD send a negative response.

  Possible responses:
        +OK Deleted user
        -ERR User does not exist
        -ERR User is currently logged in

  Example:
        C: DELE user3
        S: -ERR user does not exist
        C: DELE user1
        S: -ERR User is currently logged in
        C: DELE user2
        S: +OK Deleted user

          RFC for Mail Server Management Protocol          November 2024


6. LIST

   To obtain a list of all users, the client MUST send the following
   command:

        LIST

   If there are no users, the server MAY send a negative response.

   Possible responses:
        +OK
        <username 1>
        <username 2>
        ...

   Example:
        C: LIST
        S: +OK
        S: user1
        S: user1

   The client MAY add a parameter in order to obtain a specific user:
   
        LIST <username>

   The server MAY append additional information to the response.
   If the specified user does not exist, the server SHOULD send a 
   negative response.

   Possible responses:
        +OK
        <username> <log count>
        -ERR User does not exist

   Example:
        C: LIST user1
        S: +OK
        S: user1 69 logs

          RFC for Mail Server Management Protocol          November 2024


7. SET

   To set a configuration value, the client MUST send the following
   command:

        SET <key> <value>

   Valid keys MAY be:
        - maildir
        - transformer

   If the key is valid, the server MUST send a positive response.
   If the key is invalid, the server MUST send a negative response.

   Possible responses:
        +OK Changed value
        -ERR Invalid key

   Example:
        C: SET this_is_an_invalid_key ./maildir
        S: -ERR Invalid key
        C: SET maildir ./maildir
        S: +OK Changed value
        C: SET transformer wc
        S: +OK Changed value

8. GET

   To retrieve a configuration value, the client MUST send the following
   command:

        GET <key>

   Valid keys MAY be:
        - maildir
        - transformer

   If the key is valid, the server MUST send a positive response.
   If the key is invalid, the server MUST send a negative response.

   Possible responses:
        +OK <value>
        -ERR Invalid key

   Example:
        C: GET this_is_an_invalid_key
        S: -ERR Invalid key
        C: GET maildir
        S: +OK ./maildir
        C: GET transformer
        S: +OK wc

9. STAT

   To retrieve server statistics, the client MUST send the following
   command:

        STAT

   The statistics MAY include:
        - Total number of historical connections
        - Maximum number of simultaneous connections
        - Total number of bytes transferred

   Possible responses:
        +OK
        Total connections:              <connection count>
        Historical maximum traffic:     <max traffic>
        Total transferred bytes:        <total bytes>

   Example:
        C: STAT
        S: +OK
        S: Total connections:              156
        S: Historical maximum traffic:     201
        S: Total transferred bytes:        640028

10. LOGS

   To retrieve a list of access logs for a user, the client MUST send
   the following command:

        LOGS <username>

   If a user with the given username does not exist, the server SHOULD
   send a negative resopnse.

   Possible responses:
        +OK
        <log entries>
        -ERR Invalid user

   Example:
        C: LOGS user123
        S: +OK
        S: 2023-10-01 12:00:00 IP: 192.168.1.1
        S: 2023-10-02 14:30:00 IP: 192.168.1.2

11. Conclusion

   This protocol provides a simple and effective way to set
   configuration values, retrieve configuration values, and
   obtain server statistics.
